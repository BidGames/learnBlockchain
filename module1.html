      <p class="module_content1">
        Money fascinates us all. Doesn't it? But where does money derive its
        value from? Money, if we think about it, is just a small piece of metal
        or paper passed from person to person in exchange for anything in the
        world. As technology advances, we no longer need anything solid. Money
        has eveolved to an endless stream of 0s and 1s being circulated around
        the globe.
      </p>

        </ol>
      </div>
      <p class="module_content1">Let's go through them one by one.</p>

      <h1 class="module1_heading"><strong>Commodity Money</strong></h1>

      <p class="module_content1">
        Money whose worth is derived from the commodity from which it is created is 
        known as commodity money. Commodity money is made up of items that have 
        intrinsic worth (meaning they have value in and of themselves) as well as value 
        as a means of purchasing products. This is in contrast to representational money, 
        which has no inherent worth but may be traded for anything of value such as gold 
        or silver, and fiat money, which receives its value from government law establishing it as money.
  
        Gold, silver, copper, salt, peppercorns, tea, ornamented belts, shells, alcohol, 
        cigarettes, silk, candies, nails, cocoa beans, cowries, and barley are examples 
        of goods that have been used as mediums of trade.
      </p>

      <h1 class="module1_heading"><strong>Metallic Money</strong></h1>

      <p class="module_content1">Metals have long been used as a form of payment. As Aristotle remarked, the 
        many requirements of existence are difficult to transport; as a result, people 
        decided to utilise something inherently beneficial and easily relevant to the 
        purposes of life—for example, iron, silver, and the like—in their interactions 
        with one another. The worth of the metal was first determined by its weight, but 
        throughout time, governments or sovereigns decided to stamp it to avoid having to 
        weigh it and to make the value visible.
      </p>

      <p class="module_content1">
        Metallic money is money that is issued by a country's central bank in the form of 
        metals and serves as an unrestricted legal currency in the economy. Metallic money 
        is money whose face worth (facial value) is larger than its inherent value 
        (intrinsic value). To put it another way, metallic money is constructed of metals that 
        have a lower value than their face value. Metallic coins, for example, contain 1 rupee 
        coins, 5 rupee coins, and so on.
      </p>

      <h1 class="module1_heading"><strong>Paper Money</strong></h1>

      <p class="module_content1">
        Carrying huge amounts of gold, silver, or other metals has proven cumbersome and risked 
        loss or theft in the past. More than 1,000 years ago, paper money was first used in China. 
        Paper money and banknotes had spread to other regions of the world by the late 18th and 
        early 19th centuries. The majority of money in circulation was made up of promises to pay 
        defined sums of gold and silver, rather than actual gold or silver. Individuals or businesses 
        first made these pledges in the form of banknotes or transferrable book entries known as 
        deposits. Although deposits and banknotes originated as claims on gold or silver on deposit 
        at a bank or with a merchant, it later changed.
      </p>

      <p class="module_content1">
        This is how paper money came into existence. Paper money refers to a country's official 
        paper currency that is used in transactions to purchase goods and services. To manage the 
        flow of cash in line with monetary policy, a country's central bank or treasury often regulates 
        the creation of paper money.  Paper money is frequently updated with new versions that include 
        security measures, making it more difficult for counterfeiters to generate unauthorised reproductions.
      </p>

      <h1 class="module1_heading"><strong>Credit Money</strong></h1>

      <p class="module_content1">
        Money produced as a result of a future obligation or claim is referred to as credit money. 
        As a result, credit money is created when credit is extended or debt is issued. Commercial 
        banks can create credit money in the current fractional reserve banking system by extending 
        loans in quantities bigger than the reserves they keep in their vaults. IOUs, bonds, and money 
        markets are just a few examples of credit money. Credit money may be defined as any type of 
        financial instrument that cannot or is not intended to be returned promptly.
      </p>

      <h1 class="module1_heading"><strong>Plastic Money</strong></h1>

      <p class="module_content1">
        Plastic money refers to the usage of plastic cards such as debit/credit cards 
        in the form of electronic transactions, with the goal of removing the need for customers to carry actual 
        paper money when completing significant purchases. Debit cards, credit cards, Money access cards, client 
        cards, key cards, and Cash cards are all examples of plastic money. The sole goal of utilising these cards 
        is to make it easier for clients to make huge transactions and to ensure their personal safety.
      </p>
      
      <p class="module_content1">
        Barclays in London was the first to offer the card in 1967, followed by Chemical Banks in New York in 1969. 
        The introduction of a magnetic stripe together with personal identification numbers was a watershed moment. 
        In 1973, a hardware security module was introduced in order to make secure payments utilising microprocessor 
        technology, which was an important moment in the history of plastic money. Smart cards were then launched in 
        the late 1970s and became popular in the mid-1980s.
      </p>

      <h1 class="module1_heading"><strong>Digital Money</strong></h1>

      <p class="module_content1">
        Any type of payment that is entirely electronic is referred to as digital money (or digital currency). 
        Digital money, unlike a dollar note or a coin, is not physically palpable. Online systems are used to 
        account for and transmit it. The cryptocurrency Bitcoin is a well-known example of digital money. Fiat 
        currencies, such as dollars or euros, can also be represented by digital money. Smartphones, credit cards, 
        and online cryptocurrency exchanges are all used to swap digital money. It may be turned into actual cash 
        in some situations by using an ATM.
      </p>

      <p class="module_content1">
        In the form of currency kept in online bank accounts, a sort of digital money already exists in society today. 
        This money can be transferred or received from others. It may also be used to make online purchases. In terms of 
        idea and use, digital money is comparable to its physical counterpart in that it may be used as a unit of account 
        and a medium for daily transactions. But it isn't money. The dollars in your online bank account, for example, 
        are not digital money because they are physically withdrawn from an ATM.
      </p>

      <h1 class="module1_heading"><strong>Types of Digital Money</strong></h1>

      <h2 class="module2_heading"><strong>Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)</strong></h2>

      <p class="module_content1">
        Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are digital currencies issued by a country's central bank. They are 
        distinct from fiat currencies, which are backed by a central bank's authority and credit and constitute a 
        separate obligation of the institution. CBDCs make monetary policy easier to implement by eliminating middlemen 
        and providing a direct line of communication between the government and the common person. The involvement of 
        banks and financial entities in the distribution of national money is no longer essential. There are two sorts 
        of CBDCs, depending on how they are used and how they are implemented in the economy. Retail CBDCs, like fiat 
        currencies, are meant to be used for everyday transactions.
      </p>

      <h2 class="module2_heading"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>

      <p class="module_content1">
        Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies that use encryption to create them. A crypto shell around a digital money 
        improves security and makes transactions more resistant to tampering. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the most widely used 
        cryptocurrencies. Since 2017, cryptocurrencies' appeal as an investment class has soared, as has their value and 
        overall market capitalization. The market capitalization of cryptocurrencies has topped $2 trillion by July 2021.

        Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that was created to mitigate the price volatility of traditional cryptocurrencies. 
        Stablecoins are a type of private money whose value is linked to the value of a fiat currency or a basket of products in 
        order to maintain stability. They can act as a substitute for fiat currencies, but they are not backed by a government. In 
        recent years, the market for stablecoins has expanded. 200 stablecoins had been launched or were in development as of February 2021.
